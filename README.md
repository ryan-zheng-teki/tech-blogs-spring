# Introduction
The server we use is implemented by GraphQL. GraphQL is basically replacing our traditional multiple
restful endpoints with only one end point.  /graphql. GraphQL provides to us is a facade layer which 
we could directly interface with service layer. This saves us the need of writting more codes.

# How to use
When the server is started up, you could access the endpoint by localhost:8080/graphiql to see what endpoing
the server is providing.
